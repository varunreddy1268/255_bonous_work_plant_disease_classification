# Project title: O MyNatural

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
-          The mission of O MyNatural is to safeguard the soil from losing its fertility owing to poor farming techniques. 

-          Treating crop disease organically rather than using heavy fetilizers during plant growth can also help in protecting the soil properties.

-          Cultivating the right crop in the right soil to reduce the risk of soil property degradation. 

# ‚ÄúWe turn fertile lands into deserts by using ineffective farming technologies. There is no future until we return to effective farming and save the soil.‚Äù ‚Äì Team 11
  
Description of problem: 




# MOTIVATION üí™

* Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth.

* In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.

* In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively.

* In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

* For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.

* In the final application, the plant disease prediction application, the user may upload a photograph of a sick plant leaf, and the program will identify the condition, as well as provide some background information and treatment options.


# DATA SOURCE üìä
* [Crop recommendation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) 
* [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
